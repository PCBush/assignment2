I A child class takes on or "inherits" the methods and attributes of its parent class.
II Polymoprhism is the concept of multiple forms. A child may inherit a method from a parent class, but the method is overwridden to have somewhat different functionality. This is polymorphism.
III Encapuslations is the concept of limiting access to methods and antributes to a class.

9.
The Dictator and Lieutenant Workflow has a heirarchy. All developers pull from the central repo, but only the dictator can push to it.
The lieutenants oversee their own repositories that the developers push to.
In the Centralized workflow, there is no heirarchy and each developer has to pull any changes in the central repo and resolve conflicts before pushing.

10. 
The Dictator and Lieutenant Workflow, with its sub repositories and heirarchichal management, can be organized in a way to prevent as many push conflicts.
In a Centralized workflow, 100 people pushing to the same repo will make the version update very quickly.
In the Dictator and Lieutenant Workflow, these changes are distributed to lieutenant repositories which can be managed on their own and later updated to fit the main repo.
This could reduce the amount of time developers spend fixing conflicts.
